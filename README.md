📝Features📝

🍭 Built an awesome-looking modern style using HTML and tons of style properties of CSS such as fonts, shadows, themes, etc to look more colorful and glass-morphic design with interactive and responsive UI.

🍭 Utilised the DOM manipulation concepts of JavaScript for efficient HTML element creation and manipulation.

🍭 Used loops and map, filter methods to target each element from objects and arrays.

🍭 For conversion of the array into string used the JSON.stringify() and to get back the array again used the JSON.parse()

🍭 To retrieve the data even after the page refresh used the concept of localStorage

🍭 leveraged the functional reusability in methods for saving data of notes after change and deletion of any note or all notes

🍭 Created an event listener to delete a particular note from both localStorage and DOM tree. similarly created a deleteAllNotes method which gets executed after a button click.

🍭 Overall a fully deployed application that creates, updates, and maintains notes inside the browser with a modern-looking web design.
